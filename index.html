			<h1>TO HEAR YOU AGAIN</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Once upon a time,
We were all alone.
The days got shorter, darker, colder.
We looked for warmth.
We looked for friendship. And then
We met, you and I.
Let's jump, and run, and laugh, and stare
And wander, and wonder, and drift, and dream, and
In a daze, we'll understand. And we'll
Watch the sun setting from afar.

But wait, you're already gone.
So soon? We never even said our names.
A cloud took you, up into the sky.
But I don't have wings!
Where will you go? What awaits you
In those starry heavens? I want to see.
But you're already gone.

Would your eyes have ever filled with light at the sight of me?

It started raining.</p>
