I cannot possibly believe the fallacy that I am doing wronging her. I exert myself fully in keeping spirits in this place. I’m like a maid, preparing everything before her arrival, fanfared by motion detector, offering tea and my unwavering attention. She has a hard life, even without this rockiness, but I’m exhausted myself from trying to stay sane. I wonder how long this will go on. Today it’s fish rice, but it will be silent and cold. I’m wrapped up in a blanket, but I feel the draught of open windows on my back. I’m ready to move on from this life. I’ve done my time here. But five months more I’ll have to bear until my departure. When Summer begins." />
