When the monsoon briefly came
Cicadas seemed to sing your name
Fireworks bloomed in the night sky
And in the sea, a blue firefly

I loved, and I fell.

Dreaming of some ancient woods
Thinking of lost childhoods
How we never got to laugh, or sing, or cry
It's all in my head. A fantasy. A lie.

I cried, could you tell?

Did you ever look back, regret, and wonder
Were you right to flee the thunder?
Not to stare, teary-eyed in awe
And watch our fears be torn asunder?

Second circle, invisible hell.

Now we stand in silence and wait
Giving up on the signs of fate
Arms crossed at the deepening dusk
No words to give. A bitter husk.
When will you prove wrong my hope?
Don't let them see the bloody rope.

I told myself a little lie,
To silence this unending fight
That I can be free

But I wonder, would your eyes
Have ever filled with light
At the sight of me?

It started raining.
