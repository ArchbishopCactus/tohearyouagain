      <p>Dear ██████,</p>

<p>It’s been a while, huh? Almost two whole years since we first talked. And two months more since we last talked. We didn’t last very long as friends, did we? That’s something I regret. I was timid and awkward last year, and didn’t know how to talk to people. Especially you. Every time I was near you, it felt like I was about to overheat. I became really anxious and paranoid about saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way around you. I acted weirdly because I wanted to make a good impression and, honestly, I didn’t know how to.</p>

<p>Though, you know, your friends really didn’t help either. I don’t know why ████ and ████ hate my guts, but I’ve tried my best to be polite to them. They’ve said some hurtful things in return.</p>

<p>A lot has changed over these few years. For both of us, that’s guaranteed. You undoubtedly will no longer be the same woman I met as an overeager freshman. And I’m no longer the hunched-over guy who walked on eggshells around you and snuck erasers into your pocket.</p>

<p>All I want is another chance. I can’t deny that I still have some feelings for you, but right now I’m only here as your friend.</p>

<p>When university is up and running again, I’ll swing by your unit and say hi. No expectations, no awkwardness, okay? Let’s just talk honestly.</p>

<p>I’m coming for you, darling.</p>

<p>From ██████</p>
