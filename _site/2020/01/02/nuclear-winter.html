<meta name="description" content="WISHING FOR NUCLEAR WINTER Sometimes I find myself wondering what the world could look like in the future. There are so many possibilities, so many routes humanity could take. But I think the one I would prefer to live in the most would be a nuclear wasteland. An interesting one, of course, with monsters and all other kinds of threats. I think I’d like to try to survive in a world like that. Without order, laws to abide by. I could finally free myself from having to live with people and try faring on my own. I know in that kind of situation, people would try to flock together. Strength in numbers, as they say. I would disappear into the radioactive desert, only occasionally seen by the odd wandering group of caravans. The dangers of such a life would force me to forget about anyone I ever loved, because those kinds of thoughts would become pointless. I would no longer have to watch others find happiness and leave me in the dirt, instead knowing that I truly am better off by myself. Or at least I would be able to convince myself of that. I hate feeling vulnerable. I hate being at the mercy of people who falsify friendship, only to use me later on. I hate having hope that things will get better, only to be struck down at the most critical point. I wish I could renounce any desire of mine to be loved and not alone, so that I could ride to the edge of the world without fear of falling off it, and never again dream of hearing you again." />
