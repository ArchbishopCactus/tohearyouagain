      <p><strong>CONVICTION</strong><br />
I found a deep cut on my finger today. I don’t know how I got it, or even when.<br />
Last night, I felt worse than I had felt for a long time. Suddenly, everything I had told myself to protect my heart from further torment disappeared. Repeating the words “nothing is worth this suffering” no longer worked.<br />
Yesterday, I was supposed to be brave and face my greatest fear, to prove that I could get through this and be happy one day. I was supposed to be relaxed, friendly, and not act like the whole thing between you and I was a big deal. Instead, I hid behind a mask, saying not a single word, until I began feeling so sick that I ran away into my room. I started writing. And I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t get myself to. I tried all night, but no tears ever came. They’re all still inside me, scratching the walls of my heart and making me bleed.<br />
But if I hadn’t used the mask, nothing would have changed. ████ and ██████ would have eventually left to have fun with other people, and wouldn’t do very much to include me. Everyone else would only give me a quick polite glance, and turn away again. Because I don’t matter, I’m not friends with anyone, nobody cares about me. Nobody thinks of me.<br />
And I might have been okay with that, if only <em>you</em> thought about me. But you don’t, and you never have, and I wish I could change that, but I can’t, but I wish I could, and I tried, and maybe I’m still trying, but I know I can’t, but I don’t want to know, but I have to, but it hurts so much, and I love you, or I just want to love you, or I want to love anyone, or I want anyone to love me, or something else.<br />
Please come back, ██████. Or go away. Just don’t stick around. Don’t remind me. Don’t rub it in my face. Don’t pop up in my mind again and again and again when I don’t want you to. Love me, or stop existing. I want to stop existing.</p>
