**BACK ONLINE**  
Holy shit, are we back online? I've been pulling myself apart trying to get this all to work again.

The upgrade to Ruby 3.1 complicated more than a few things, but on top of that, I didn't realise the generation of the repository on my new hard drive created folders that are supposed to be handled by the theme's source. All I had to do was delete them, and voilá! Everything is looking exactly as it should once again.

I can't believe I was so dense as to let the syntax errors in the console distract me from what was actually going on. Of course the SCSS converter was throwing a fit about my main.css file; there wasn't supposed to BE a main.css file!

Anyway, this is what happens when a clueless amateur designer tries to learn webdev on the fly. Take it as a warning ... or a challenge.

And it was all in time for the (new) New Year. God, it's hard to believe how long it's been since I started this...and how long I've been stuck in this place, for better or worse.

But there'll be time to write about that. There'll be time.
