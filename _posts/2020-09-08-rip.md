So, that didn't go as planned. This is getting ridiculous. I bought this website (£1 is still money!) and went through all the effort of getting GitHub Pages to work. Why am I not using it? I have maybe half a year left of this license and I want to make sure I do something with this. It was supposed to be a creative and emotional outlet and so far, I've only used in when I *really* wanted to. It's more like a log of rage than a diary. Wait, was it supposed to be a diary?

It's been so long that I've forgotten how to even operate the terminal and get Git to commit my changes. Gonna have to learn that again, yay. I think I'll just upload it to the browser version for now though.
