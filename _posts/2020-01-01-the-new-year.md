**THE NEW YEAR**  
I'm getting quite worried about the amount of work I still need to complete before the holidays are out. It's not like I should have started earlier, as I still needed some time to myself, but it didn't feel like it was time to myself at all. If it wasn't for my mother, I wouldn't even celebrate my birthday. Of course, that's not the real problem. I messed up with a lot of things last semester, and now I have to pay the price.  
But it's so difficult to start working when all I feel like doing is...not existing. While I was in the bath yesterday, I just wanted to slit my wrists and bleed out into the water. It's so difficult, being alone. It feels like there's a piece missing, and the whole puzzle falls apart because of it. I feel incomplete and broken.  
I guess that's why I started writing, so I can act as if you're watching, reading, judging, deciding whether you'll give me another chance. I know you won't, but I have to at least believe with this illusion. Although, calling it an illusion probably won't help. Maybe I should stop writing about these things and just show you what I've been up to.  
A few days ago, I tried making some trees from scratch. I drew some leaves on a flat plane, used them as a hair particle system in Blender, and applied it to a simple low-poly tree mesh I made using the Skin modifier. I experimented a little bit with the colours, but the trickiest part was actually to get a cost-effective amount of particles that still made the foliage look somewhat dense.

The results aren't great, but I'm going to try a few different methods of making both the atlas textures and the mesh for the trunk.  
I also tried out Substance Alchemist for the first time and got some cool results. The brick generator has a few good options for the style of the bricks, and of course, playing around with the proportions always makes for good iteration and experimentation.

I think you'd really like this kind of thing. I know you're quite tech-savvy already, but I have to admit, your 3D model of a bottle was kind of lacking. Although you actually unwrapped a UV texture onto it, so that's a great start! The next step will be to get you familiar with things like normal/roughness/metallic maps and procedural textures, and get you to model things a bit more loosely. You can do a lot with just mesh modelling from a reference image, you don't always need measurements to make something look accurate!  
Also, I would have liked to see you model something a bit more personal to you. How about that necklace with the flower-shaped gems? Or maybe your blue glue gun. I remember how much you used that thing last year. So let's work together to make amazing digital things together, okay?
