..........REPEATING TRANSMISSION..........
This is ██████ ██ ████ █ █████, I've been stranded at outpost TN22 5██ east of U█kf████ since Q4 of 2022. I'm lacking the components necessary for making a means of escape, but for now my vitals are stable, so I'm keeping my head down until I see an opening...or forge one myself.

If you're reading this, know that for me, the pandemic never ended. Only the force of isolation changed, from a novel one to something far more present throughout my life.

My life has become still, frozen in time despite it continuing to pass outside the window. When I finally make it out of here, IF I make it out of here, I'll make my debut into the world even more deserving of celebration. And that includes sharing it with the people who push me towards that goal, even if they have the possibility for becoming obstacles in themselves.
