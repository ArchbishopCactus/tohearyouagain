I'm beginning to wonder if it's here I should be. I don't like either option. It's depressing here. Some days, it's all affectionate and friendly. Others, batshit crazy bouts of anger followed by muffled crying from the next room. I only try to stick to myself and do my best, and she turns it into cardinal sin. I cannot possibly believe that what I am doing is wronging her.  
I exert myself fully in keeping spirits in this place. I'm like a maid preparing everything before her arrival, fanfared by the motion detector at the gate, offering tea and my unwavering attention. She has a hard life, even without this rockiness, but I'm exhausted myself from trying to stay sane.  
I wonder how long this will go on.  
Today it's fish rice, but it will be silent and cold. I'm wrapped up in a blanket, but I feel the draught of open windows on my back.  
I'm ready to move on from this life. I've done my time here. But five months more I'll have to bear until my departure. When Summer begins.
