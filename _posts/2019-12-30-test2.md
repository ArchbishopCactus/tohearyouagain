Is this working now? Can you hear me?  
I finally got this page up and running. It took me a while, but I'm glad I spent the effort in figuring out how to make it work. Now I can show you what I've been up to! I hope you enjoy reading my story.  
Oh, why did I make this place? Well, I realised that I haven't really had the chance to talk to you in a long time. I know we're not on the best of terms, but I wanted to try starting over. So I decided to write to you.  
Truth is, I've missed you. And I think about you a lot. It's likely that things will never be as they once were, but I have to believe that you'll read this one day. Maybe it will become clearer then.  
Until then, I'll keep going. Even if it's pretty one-sided. But that's okay! I just have to believe there's a reason for me to do this. Even if that reason is to keep me alive...
