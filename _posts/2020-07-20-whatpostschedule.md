Hello all (which is probably just myself), I have good news. Having found myself suddenly relieved of a great deal of academic pressure, whichever way you would like to interpret that, I am now making an effort to return to this little hobby of mine and write more regular submissions. After all, this is supposed to be a diary of sorts, and what's the point of a diary that has barely any entries?  
Anyway, that's it. Be on the look-out for more coming soon. And hey, Markdown easily supports images! So I should surely use that feature more often.  
Goodbye, and until next time.
