Dear ██████,

It's been a while, huh? Almost two whole years since we first talked. And two months more since we last talked. We didn't last very long as friends, did we? That's something I regret. I was timid and awkward last year, and didn't know how to talk to people. Especially you. Every time I was near you, it felt like I was about to overheat. I became really anxious and paranoid about saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way around you. I acted weirdly because I wanted to make a good impression and, honestly, I didn't know how to.

Though, you know, your friends really didn't help either. I don't know why ████ and ████ hate my guts, but I've tried my best to be polite to them. They've said some hurtful things in return.

A lot has changed over these few years. For both of us, that's guaranteed. You undoubtedly will no longer be the same woman I met as an overeager freshman. And I'm no longer the hunched-over guy who walked on eggshells around you and snuck erasers into your pocket.

All I want is another chance. I can't deny that I still have some feelings for you, but right now I'm only here as your friend.

When university is up and running again, I'll swing by your unit and say hi. No expectations, no awkwardness, okay? Let's just talk honestly.

I'm coming for you, darling.

From ██████
