I awoke later than I should have. But it's been like that for a while now, hasn't it? The sun had already risen, and I believed today would have been a half-normal day, at least. But then I remembered a dream.  
I often dream of you. Not about dragons or magic or flying or falling or shouting or crying. It's always the same, numb feeling. Numb, but pulling. So much that I don't ever want to leave. We talk, sparsely, but we talk. And for a moment, I'm hopeful that I can fix it. That you'll help me fix it, and cease this avoidant charade. Slowly, I notice a change, and the sun seems to shine brighter. But I'm quickly dragged out by reality, and I wake to an emptiness inside that makes me pray for death.  
This time, that image of you that appeared in my mind, a construct of my deepest desire <span style="color:red">**to hear you again**</span>, was unambiguously cold. Even I noticed it. You ignored my efforts to communicate, and neglected my presence.  
Were you ever really like that? I don't remember. It's all a blur now. It was hard to realise what was really going on, as my vision was narrowed towards you only. I wanted to believe there was a reason for your actions, that my pain would be justified in the end. But you left anyway, and everyone around you left me with the realisation that I was *never* your friend.  
I know there's a way to reach you, to find the warm heart you hide inside. I know there is a kind-hearted, sensitive person in there. I just wish I could have gotten the chance to see her.
